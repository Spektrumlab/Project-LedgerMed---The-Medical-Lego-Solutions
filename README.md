Welcome to the GitHub repository for Project "LedgerMed" â€“ The Medical Lego Solution. This initiative aims to seamlessly integrate emerging technologies with the digital health ecosystem. At its core, LedgerMed seeks to unify the fragmented segments of individual digital health projects into a singular, complex, and composable blockchain-based platform. This platform boasts a highly operative structure, primarily based on Web3 technologies, yet incorporates certain Web2 elements to facilitate hybrid cooperation.
LedgerMed also embraces AI-powered solutions, Metaverse applications, Digital Twins, MioTs, and the principles of Medical Industry 4.0. Our current focus is on the conceptual and ideation stages of the project. We are designing LedgerMed from a user-centric perspective, catering to everyone from patients and healthcare professionals to administrative and support services. Our goal is to design and craft intuitive apps and user interfaces for front-end users while preparing robust solutions for back-end operators. Additionally, we are developing the idea of the core matrix that will oversee and coordinate the entire system.
As the main stakeholders in the LedgerMed solution, we propose partnerships with medical health funds, supply chain providers, insurance companies, and legal experts.
We are committed to making LedgerMed a substantial and fully operational component of a sustainable and high-quality digital health system. We invite you to explore, contribute, and join us in this ambitious endeavor to reshape healthcare through technology.
